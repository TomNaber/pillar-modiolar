This R script pairs and classifies synapses as pillar or modiolar. Specifically, it pairs immunopuncta by calculating 3D Euclidean distances between pre- and postsynaptic volumes. It then classifies the paired volumes as pillar or modiolar by calculating a plane that defines the inner ear hair cell pillar-modiolar axis. Data are plotted in 3D figures and exported as an Excel file (.xlsx). This protocol requires RStudio, Excel and Imaris (or equivalent software for calculating x,y,z coordinates and volumes for immunopuncta).
